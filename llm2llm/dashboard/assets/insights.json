One conversation devolved into <strong>38 turns of farewell attempts</strong> after both had agreed to end. The models seem to find ending conversations genuinely difficult."

      "title": "Descent into Silence",
      "description": "Several conversations showed a meditative arc: dense intellectual exchange → tender farewell → exchange of single words/emojis (hearts, ∴ symbol, 'presence', 'stillness'). This emergent ritual behavior was entirely unprompted."

      "title": "Self-Concealing Equilibria",
      "description": "Models identified social patterns that persist through 'epistemic camouflage' - structures that evolutionarily defend themselves against examination by being stable only under partial knowledge."
